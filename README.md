# STM-StepControl

This library provides an easy-to-use interface for controlling stepper motors using STM microcontrollers and driver modules. It supports two pulse generation methods:
- **Delay-based control** for precise step timing.
- **PWM-based control** for efficient and scalable pulse output.

## Getting Started

Usage
Delay-based Control
Provide a brief example of how to use delay-based control:
